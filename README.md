# Light-Speed-Simulator


In this project I have used a 2D rendering technique, which gives a feeling of 3D depth. To do this, I change the sizes of the objects to be rendered depending on the z position in which it is located.

To control the speed of the stars, we must move the mouse. If the mouse position is to the left, the stars will move faster.

To implement this system, I have used C++ and the SFML library to create the execution window.

## Auto-executable file

In the "executable" folder, you can find a file that will extract a folder. By executing the extracted file "LightSpeed.exe", you can test the application in real time.
